Duke University
Postdoctoral Fellowship in Data Curation for Visual Studies
 

Overview
Duke University is offering a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Data Curation for Visual Studies, jointly appointed by the Duke University Libraries and the Department of Art, Art History, and Visual Studies. Eligible candidates will have completed a doctoral program in Art History, Digital Media, Historical and Cultural Visualization, or a related field in the past five years. This is a full-time, two-year appointment, with an annual salary of $60,000, including full benefits.

With supervision and guidance provided by Duke University Libraries, the Postdoctoral Fellow will work closely with faculty and researchers in their field of research and expertise (for example, with the Wired! Lab for Visualizing the Past) to develop best practices for managing a wide variety of multimedia source materials, especially maps, models, animations, 3D reconstructions, for reuse in teaching and digital project development (see: Wired! Lab Research projects). The Fellow will explore and analyze tools and platforms, write documentation, and aid in dissemination of best practices to the wider campus community as well as assisting in training in the use of tools. These activities will culminate in defining, modeling, and testing workflows and capacities necessary for sustainable curation and long-term management and re-use of these visual materials.

The ideal candidate will have both relevant academic training and experience with content management and data infrastructure development for humanities projects that have a visual data component. During the fellowship period the Fellow will work closely with the Duke University Libraries and the discipline-matched faculty and researchers to gain significant knowledge of best practices in markup languages, metadata standards, digital humanities curation, and digital repository structures and workflows. The Fellow will be expected to continue to develop his or her ongoing research within a field of study compatible with the faculty/researcher partnership. The Fellow will also participate in the activities sponsored by the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) Postdoctoral Fellowship program.  

The CLIR/Duke University Postdoctoral Fellowship in Data Curation for Visual Studies provides an exciting opportunity to contribute to new initiatives at one of the nation’s highest-ranked research universities, as well as to gain skills and knowledge related to emerging, innovative areas of visual studies research and teaching as well as to digital humanities curation. Through these fellowships, CLIR seeks to raise awareness and build capacity for sound data management practice throughout the academy.  Opportunities to lead, engage, or collaborate in workshops, seminars, presentations, and publications will be strongly encouraged and supported.

Roles & Responsibilities
Reporting to the Associate University Librarian for Information Technology Services, the Postdoctoral Fellow will collaborate with faculty, students, library staff, and technologists to advance the Libraries’ data curation strategy for multimedia materials and to support researchers in learning and applying best practices for digital preservation and curation. The Fellow will serve as a liaison to students and faculty, such as within the Wired! Lab, in order to gain hands-on experience working with visual materials as part of teaching and research and to better understand access and use requirements. The Fellow will partner with Libraries staff and technologists to translate these requirements into a sustainable approach to curating visual studies data and to help train graduate students and faculty in data curation. Through this research activity, the Fellow will play a key role in developing a model for visual studies data curation that will be of immediate benefit to visual studies researchers and teaching faculty at Duke University, and will contribute significantly to enhancing the Libraries’ services and programs in support of digital humanities scholarship.

Specific areas of responsibility for the Postdoctoral Fellow and related tasks include:

Help to develop a sustainable program for visual studies data curation
	Explore and assess visual materials curation at peer universities and present a memorandum on best practices in digital multimedia management to Libraries staff and other Duke technologists, and faculty, researchers, and administrators engaged in visual studies data management
	Survey the landscape of visual materials curation at Duke to determine current practice, including formats used and requirements for access and reuse
	Research, design, and pilot the creation of a data curation program built upon sustainable workflows for organization, access, and preservation of multimedia-based collections in support of ongoing teaching/research projects. These collection materials might include images, texts, document transcriptions, geo-referenced maps, 3D models, A/V files, and other file types.
	Analyze the pilot data curation program; make recommendations for alterations, sustainability, and lessons learned; and publish or present the outcomes both locally (to Duke stakeholders) and nationally
	Provide researchers with instruction and guidance in visual studies data curation

Recommend best practices for standardized description and for resource and data management planning for academic users within the context of multimedia-based visual studies (such as the Wired!
